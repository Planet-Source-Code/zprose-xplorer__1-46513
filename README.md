### Description

My school did not allow us to access explorer, or any drive beyond our network drive or a:\. In addition, we could not run any unapproved apps. Needless to say, this situation was unacceptable so I took a few min and did this little vba app in excel (which we could access). It acts as an explorer, allowing the user to navigate drives, subfolders and run apps. It uses the filesystemobject and the shell command to work and the data is displayed via listboxes. It is a demo of the get files/folders/parent dir with use of the filesystemobject. Hope it helps (this is assuming you can rum macros with your security program running).
